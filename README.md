This console application illustrates the use of the Mediator pattern. 
A chat room component acts as mediator between person components which only communicate to each other via the chat room.

Unfortunately the application has a bug which is preventing people in the chat room from communicating. Your job is to find the bug and fix it. Add code comments to explain your fix.

Thank you for your time.
